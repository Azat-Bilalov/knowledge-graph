# Overview

## Purpose

This project is a lightweight web-based research tool for exploring, validating,
visualizing, and comparing medical knowledge graphs generated by large language models (LLMs).

The system is designed for:

- educational use (courses on knowledge graphs and medical ontologies);
- research experiments on consistency, completeness, and consensus of LLM-generated knowledge.

This is NOT a production system.

## Core idea

Multiple LLMs generate structured representations of medical knowledge.
These representations may differ in:

- structure,
- completeness,
- logical chains,
- inferred conclusions.

The application allows:

1. Inputting multiple LLM outputs side-by-side.
2. Normalizing different input formats into a single canonical graph model.
3. Visualizing each graph individually.
4. Visualizing a diff-graph highlighting agreements and disagreements.

## Scope and constraints

### In scope

- Client-side only web application
- Multiple input formats (A–D)
- Canonical internal graph representation
- Graph visualization via Graphviz
- Diff-graph visualization
- Error reporting and validation feedback
- Help section with format descriptions and LLM prompt examples

### Explicitly out of scope

- Backend or server-side logic
- Authentication or user accounts
- Data persistence (no saving/loading projects)
- Manual graph editing
- Performance optimization for very large graphs
- Clinical decision support or medical advice

---

## Target users

- Students studying:
  - knowledge graphs
  - medical ontologies
  - AI-assisted knowledge extraction
- Researchers evaluating:
  - consistency of LLM outputs
  - structural properties of generated knowledge graphs

## Design principles

- **Format-agnostic UI**  
  The user interface must not depend on specific input formats (A–D).

- **Canonical-first processing**  
  All operations after parsing must use a canonical graph model.

- **Low coupling**  
  Parsing, normalization, visualization, and UI must be loosely coupled.

- **Explainability**  
  Errors and differences must be explicit and inspectable.

- **Minimalism (MVP)**  
  Only essential features are implemented.
